        Blink

        There are three LEDs, using pins 13 through 11.
        It turns on and off pin 13, then does the same for 12, and lastly the same for 11.
        It will continue this loop forever.

      <p>I picked these values for the resistors because I wanted the LEDs to get progressively darker. I also knew that I wanted to keep the current below 20 mAh. 
        So I started with the two resistors that would get me close to 20 mAh with a red led being powered by 5v. This ended up
        being two 100 ohm resistors. From there I just looked through the kit for the next largest resistor which was the 220 one.
        The next largest was then the 330 one, so I used that for the darkest. I also paired the 330 one with a blue LED which decreased the voltage more than the other LEDs.
