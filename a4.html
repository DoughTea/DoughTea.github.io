      <p>On the left you can see a gif of the assignment working. 
      This is pre calibrated. It starts with my finger off the capacitive sensor(white wire). Then when I put my finger on it, the servo moves.

      <p> I used a 1 mega Ohm resistor because that is what was used in the example in class. We used this so that it is easy to detect when we have given the electrons a better way to groundthemselves. If we wanted to make it more sensitive we could increase the resistor.

    <div class="header">
      <p>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9.</p>
      <img src="A4Graph.jpeg" />
      <br>
      <p> It would look like this because it would only get 5v when moving. Then during the delay there would be no voltage. It does always have current, even when not moving.</p>

    <div>
      <p>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The easiest way to fix this is have it compare the last value to the current value. If the values are very different (indicating a large jump), it is reasonable to believe that it might be a erroneous reading. So in that case we can discard it.

    <div>
      <p>3:  Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        You could address this by averaging out the numbers you get over a set amount of time and using that as the reading. An example could be splitting measurements of 1 second over the course of 10 seconds, during the 1 second you are saving the output to a list. At the end of the second you average the list and use that as the reading for that second. This would prevent the outliars from causing problems.
