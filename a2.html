      <p>On the left you can see a gif of the assignment working. 
        It fades through the three LEDs and then repeats the process when the button is pressed.

      <p>I limited the current going through the button by added a 220 ohm resistor. I chose this one in part because we have so many
        but also because it would keep the current less than 40 mA. The reason I wanted to keep it less than 40 mA is because that is 
        the max that a single pin can handle. By doing it this way we are much lower than the maximum current allowed.

      <p>2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My three LEDs draw 15, 7.7, and 15 mA. Which is 37.7 mA. The battery is 1200 mAh. So we can just do 1200 / 37.7 which
        gives us 31.83 hours. This is assuming that all of the LEDs are on the whole time. If we want to know how long it 
        would last with the button pressed and it running in a cycle we first should find out how long a cycle is and how much 
        power it draws during it. (15mh * (.61sec * 1/3600 [to convert hours to seconds])) is .00254 mhA during the first and 
        third LED. (7.7mh * (.61sec * 1/3600 [to convert hours to seconds])) is .00131 during the second LED. So in 1.83 seconds
        it uses .00639 mhA. 1200 / .00639 = 187793.42 which times 1.83 is 343,662 seconds. Which gives us our anwer of 95.5 hours.
        Which makes sense since it is 3 times longer than if they were all running at once. We could have just done 31.83 * 3 to
        get our answer, but then we would have missed out on a lot of fun math.
